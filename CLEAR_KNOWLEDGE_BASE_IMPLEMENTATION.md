# Clear Knowledge Base Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added "Clear Knowledge Base" functionality to the knowledge base page with the following components:

## 1. API Endpoint
**File:** `app/api/knowledge-base/clear/route.ts`
- Handles POST requests to clear the knowledge base
- Forwards requests to n8n webhook: `https://n8n.srv934833.hstgr.cloud/webhook/empty-knowledge-base`
- Payload structure:
  - `accessToken`: User authentication token (sent in Authorization Bearer header)

## 2. User Interface Updates
**File:** `components/knowledge-base-sidebar.tsx`
- Added "Clear Knowledge Base" button in the sidebar footer
- Red-themed button with trash icon
- Confirmation dialog to prevent accidental clearing
- Responsive design (works in both expanded and collapsed sidebar states)

## 3. Main Page Integration
**File:** `app/knowledge-base/page.tsx`
- Added `clearKnowledgeBase` handler function
- Added loading state management (`isClearingKnowledgeBase`)
- Integrated with toast notifications for user feedback
- Auto-refreshes media library after clearing

## 4. User Experience Features
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Prevents accidental clearing with clear warning message
- **Visual Feedback**: Red-themed button indicates destructive action
- **Loading States**: Shows processing state during API calls
- **Toast Notifications**: Success/error messages for user feedback
- **Auto-refresh**: Updates UI after successful clearing

## 5. Security Features
- Authentication required (access token validation)
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental actions
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Bearer token authentication for API calls

## 6. Button Location
The "Clear Knowledge Base" button is located in the knowledge base sidebar footer, below the "View Knowledge Base" button, making it easily accessible but not prominently displayed to prevent accidental clicks.

## Usage Instructions
1. Navigate to Knowledge Base page
2. Look for the red "Clear Knowledge Base" button in the sidebar footer
3. Click the button to open confirmation dialog
4. Confirm the action to clear the entire knowledge base
5. Wait for success notification and automatic UI refresh

## API Integration
- **Endpoint**: `/api/knowledge-base/clear`
- **Method**: POST
- **Headers**: 
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
  - `Authorization: Bearer {accessToken}`
- **Body**: `{ "accessToken": "..." }`
- **Webhook**: `https://n8n.srv934833.hstgr.cloud/webhook/empty-knowledge-base`

## Testing
- Created test script: `test-clear-kb.js`
- All components have proper error handling
- UI provides clear feedback for all operations
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental clearing

## Implementation Notes
- Button only appears when `onClearKnowledgeBase` prop is provided
- Uses AlertDialog component for confirmation
- Integrates seamlessly with existing sidebar design
- Follows the same patterns as other destructive actions in the app
